	<p>
		Dear Team, 
		Just wanted to share our first completion on the New Tappan Zee Bridge of the Belvedere 1 Benches. These are the first in a string of highly unique and complex benches and canopies to be installed along the new pedestrian and bike path on the bridge.

		Thank you to the whole team for the huge effort in pushing this forward, especially the assembly team at Rock Tavern and Karl for giving them the final touch on site!
