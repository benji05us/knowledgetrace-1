	<h1>UAP US : No heat deformation on Joel Shapiro's latest work</h1><hr>
	<h1>General Comment</h1>
	<p>
		There's no substitute for using thick plate if you dont watn heat distortion.  Joe insists on super sharp lines and flat surfaces. We dont mess around with thin plate in these scenarios.  I generall work with 3/8" ( 10mm ) as a miniumium.  This particular work is in 5/8" ( 16mm ) aluminum plate as the surfaces are long and flat - no room to hide distortion.
